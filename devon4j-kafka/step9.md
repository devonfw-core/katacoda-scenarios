## Start the Kafka server

To run the test, it is required to have Zookeeper and Kafka server running. Execute the following two commands to start the server. You need a separate terminal for each server. By clicking on the commands new windows will be opened automatically.
`/root/kafka/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh /root/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties`{{execute T2}}

`/root/kafka/bin/kafka-server-start.sh /root/kafka/config/server.properties`{{execute T3}}

## Run the unit test
Switch back to the first terminal and run the test.

`cd devonfw/workspaces/main/devon4j-kafka/core/`{{execute T1}}

`mvn clean test -Dtest=com.devonfw.application.employee.employeemanagement.service.impl.rest.KafkaDemoServiceTest`{{execute T1}}

This may take a while. If the result shows one passed test, the Kafka consumer is performing as expected.
