## Setting up the java backend

CobiGen uses the backend classes for generating your code used in the angular application.

Inside the devonfw directory navigate to the folder 'workspaces/main/cobigen-angular/'.
`cd workspaces/main/cobigen-angular/`{{execute}}

This folder contains a zipped java project. Unzip the project.
`unzip cobigen-angular.zip`{{execute}}

This java project contains an employee class with some attributes. This class is used to generate the frontend files later in this tutorial.

Navigate into the java project and build it.
`cd devon4j-templateserver/`{{execute}}

`devon mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`{{execute}}

It is not necessary to write 'devon' before the commands when you are inside the devonfw IDE. In this case the correct maven installation, which was installed with the devonfw IDE, would be used without the 'devon', as well.
